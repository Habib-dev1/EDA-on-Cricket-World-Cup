🏏 EDA on Cricket World Cup

This project explores match, team, and player statistics from various Cricket World Cup tournaments using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Through visualizations and statistical insights, it highlights batting trends, bowling dominance, match outcomes, and historical patterns that shaped the game across different eras.

📌 Objectives

Perform in-depth analysis of Cricket World Cup datasets.

Explore batting, bowling, and all-round performance across teams.

Analyze winning factors such as toss decisions, run rates, strike rates, and partnerships.

Compare performances across different years and teams.

Highlight standout players, match-winning moments, and long-term trends.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy → Data cleaning and wrangling

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Interactive exploration

📊 Key Insights

📈 Batting Patterns → Average runs scored per World Cup, strike rate analysis, powerplay vs death overs impact.

🎯 Bowling Trends → Economy rate distribution, wickets taken per tournament, and effectiveness of spinners vs pacers.

🏆 Winning Strategies → Toss influence on match outcomes, target vs chase success rates.

👑 Player Performance → Top scorers, leading wicket-takers, and consistency metrics.

🔄 Historical Comparisons → Evolution of run rates and batting dominance from early years to modern cricket.
